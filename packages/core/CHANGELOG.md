### Minor Changes

- 6f61f1d: Drag and drop — `dragAndDrop: true`.

  Drag a node onto another to reparent it, or onto the leading or trailing
  quarter of one to drop it beside that node instead. A reparent that could only
  say "into" is half a feature: reordering siblings is most of what anyone does
  with a file list.

  Which axis those bands run along is a question only the layout can answer, so
  it asks. A file list stacks downward whatever `orientation` says; a tidy chart
  puts siblings across its growth axis; a wheel offers `into` and nothing else,
  because sibling segments are arranged by angle and "three degrees
  anticlockwise" is not a position anyone is pointing at.

  Dropping into the branch you are carrying is refused — a node cannot become
  its own descendant — and shown in the refusal colour rather than not shown,
  since an absence cannot tell "not allowed" apart from "not pointing at
  anything". The check is one array read per pointer move, from a subtree mask
  built when the drag starts.

  The move is reported through `nodeDrop` BEFORE anything happens; call
  `preventDefault()` to refuse it. Dragging a selected node carries the whole
  selection. The chart applies the move to its own copy of the data rather than
  mutating the array you handed it, so reconcile your own store from the event.

  New theme tokens: `dropStroke`, `dropRefusedStroke`, `dropStrokeWidth`. New
  core exports for anyone building their own gesture layer: `resolveDropMode`,
  `isDropAllowed`, `subtreeMask`, `dropPosition`.

- 66cbb55: Drag and drop, completed.

  **A card follows the cursor.** The node stays where it is, dimmed, and a copy
  travels — the convention every file manager uses, and for a reason: the
  original is where the node still is until you let go, and a drag you can
  abandon needs something to abandon it to. The copy is a clone of your own
  overlay element, so it looks exactly right whatever your card is, including
  your CSS.

  **The chart pans at the edges.** Without it a drop is only possible onto
  something already on screen, which on a chart big enough to need dragging is
  usually the wrong place. The speed ramps with depth into the zone rather than
  switching on at a line.

  **The keyboard can move a node too.** Focus a row in the screen-reader tree,
  press `m` to pick it up, move to another row, press `m` again to drop it in,
  or Escape to put it back. Announced through a live region, because a keyboard
  user gets no drop preview — the announcement is the feedback, not a courtesy
  on top of it. `into` only: the row list gives no way to point at a gap between
  two things, and reparenting is the part with no other keyboard route.

  **`nodeDrop` in Vue and React.** `@node-drop` and `onNodeDrop`, emitted
  synchronously so `preventDefault()` on the payload still works.

  Also: overlay elements now carry `data-klad-id`. Slots are pooled and
  reassigned as the camera moves, so this is the only way to find the element
  currently showing a given node — a drag needs it to clone the card, and a test
  needs it to assert a node rendered.

### Patch Changes

- cfddd4a: A drop now animates, and holds the place you dropped it.

  Two things a reparent got wrong. The chart rebuilt from a new dataset, which
  as far as the engine was concerned shared no index space with the old one — so
  every node snapped to its new position with no tween. And because a `tidy` or
  `radial` layout reflows around the change, the destination you had just aimed
  at slid somewhere else, leaving you to find your place again.

  `ChartEngine.animateNextLayout(sourceRemap)` says the next `setData` is a MOVE:
  the same nodes at different positions, with a mapping from the outgoing index
  space to the incoming one. The transition then reads across it and tweens.
  It is tied to `setData` rather than to "the next relayout" on purpose — the
  mapping describes one replacement, so arming it without one does nothing.

  The vanilla chart arms it on every drop and, alongside it, pins the drop
  TARGET's screen position across the rebuild. The target, not the moved node:
  anchoring what you dragged would pull the camera along with it, which is the
  one thing that is supposed to move.

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- ae1e116: The wheel layouts now show when a node is hiding something.

  A radial marker is a dot and a sunburst segment is a slice of a ring — neither
  has room for a disclosure control, so a collapsed branch there looked exactly
  like a leaf. The chart was omitting the fact that there was more, which is
  worse than showing less.

  Nodes whose children are all off screen now carry a mark: a second arc just
  inside a segment's outer edge, a halo around a radial marker. "Off screen"
  covers both reasons a wheel has — the branch is closed, or its children fell
  outside `maxRings` — because those are one question to a viewer and get one
  answer. It is computed once per relayout (`Frame.hasHidden`), not per frame,
  and the array is `null` whenever nothing is hiding anything, which is the whole
  steady state of a fully expanded chart.

  The SVG and PNG exports draw it too.

  The `radial` layout also gains `toggleOnNodeClick` in the playground's preset:
  paired with the mark, it gives a viewer a way to open and close branches on a
  chart whose nodes are too small to hold a button.

- 84df523: `setLayoutOptions(settings, opts?)` — change how the tree is arranged after
  construction, without the tree-state reset `update(data, options)` causes.

  The shape itself and every knob that tunes it: `layout`, `layoutStep`,
  `rowGap`, `maxRings`, `colourBranches`, `spacing`, `orientation`, `rtl`. The
  same paint-only discipline `setTheme` and `setMinimap` already follow — this
  is the layout-shaped hole in that set. Dragging an indent slider is not a
  reason to re-collapse a tree the viewer just opened.

  The camera does not move by default, because a chart that jumped to a fit on
  every tick of a slider is unusable as a control. Every one of these knobs does
  change how big the drawing is, though, so pass `{ fit: true }` to settle the
  view once a drag ends; the fit is queued and happens after the relayout lands,
  rather than against the bounds it is about to replace.

  `LayoutSettings` is exported (and re-exported from the React and Vue
  adapters), as are `DEFAULT_PALETTE`/`DARK_PALETTE` and `LayoutName`.

- beb8dc3: Layout is now something you choose: `layout: 'tidy' | 'file' | 'radial' | 'sunburst'`.

  Each of the three new shapes brings the treatment it actually needs, rather
  than being the tiered chart with the boxes moved:

  - **`file`** — the file-explorer shape, and the one layout whose width does not
    grow with the tree. One indented row per node, with folder guide lines down
    the indent gutter. `layoutStep` sets the indent, `rowGap` the space between
    rows.
  - **`radial`** — root at the centre, each generation a ring further out, every
    name turned to run along its own spoke and flipped on the left-hand side so
    nothing reads upside down. `layoutStep` sets the ring spacing.
  - **`sunburst`** — the tree as a wheel of nested arc segments, each sized by
    what it holds. Labels are laid on the segments themselves — along the ring
    where there is room, outward along the ray where there isn't, and skipped
    where neither fits, so nothing is ever drawn clipped.

  **Drilling into a sunburst.** `setCentre(id)` — or the `centre` option —
  re-centres the wheel on one node: it widens to the full circle and travels
  inward while everything outside it closes at the seam, over about 600ms. This
  is deliberately not `isolate`. Nothing is pruned, so every node has a before
  and an after and the change animates rather than cuts; the wheel's frame does
  not depend on what is at its centre, so the camera never moves. `getCentre()`
  and each node's ancestors are enough to build a breadcrumb. `maxRings` sets how
  many rings are drawn around the centre.

  **Colour.** Nodes can be filled by which top-level branch they belong to, from
  a validated eight-hue categorical palette (`theme.palette`, with a dark set to
  match). On by default for the sunburst, whose segments have neither position
  nor connectors to carry structure; off everywhere else, and `colourBranches`
  overrides either way. Hues are assigned in fixed order and never cycled — a
  ninth branch takes a neutral rather than repeating slot one — depth steps the
  branch's own hue lighter in OKLab, and each label's ink is chosen against the
  fill actually behind it.

  Connectors follow the layout: the tiered elbow for `tidy`, folder spines for
  `file`, straight spokes for `radial`, none at all for `sunburst`. All of it —
  shapes, sector geometry and label placement — is shared between the canvas and
  the SVG/PNG export, so an export still matches what is on screen.

  `orientation` continues to apply to `tidy` only; a file list is a vertical list
  of rows whatever you set, and a wheel has no reading direction.

  Also fixed: an `lr`/`rl` chart exported to SVG or PNG drew every card with its
  width and height swapped.

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- c44e9db: `data` is now the only option without a default.

  `nodeSize` defaults to `{ w: 180, h: 64 }` — a readable name-and-role card at
  1:1, exported as `DEFAULT_NODE_SIZE` for anyone sizing their own cards around
  it. `label` defaults to whichever of `name`, `label` or `title` a node
  actually carries, falling back to its `id`.

  ```ts
  createKlad(host, { data }); // a working chart
  ```

  Both were required before, and neither had to be: the first was a number
  almost every chart set to something similar, and the second was a one-line
  accessor over a field the data was already using. Between them they made the
  smallest possible chart three options long and made a missing label look like
  a rendering fault rather than a setting. Explicit values behave exactly as
  before — including `label: () => ''` for a node that should stay blank.

- 96b337f: `isolate(id)` — show one branch as if it were the whole chart.

  `fitSubtree` points the camera at a branch and leaves the rest of the chart
  where it was, off screen. `isolate` re-roots the tree: that node becomes the
  root and everything else stops existing as far as layout, hit-testing, the
  minimap, the keyboard tree, search and export are concerned. On a chart of tens
  of thousands of nodes that is the difference between a tight camera on a big
  chart and a small chart.

  `isolate(null)` restores the whole tree. `getState().isolated` reports it, and
  a saved view carries it, so a link can open someone else on the same branch.
  Where the viewer is inside the whole tree is left to the host to say —
  `pathTo(id)` returns the chain from the real root, which is a breadcrumb.

- 29ecb6e: Keyboard control of the camera, `fitSubtree(id)`, and saveable views.

  **Keyboard.** Clicking a chart and pressing an arrow key used to do nothing:
  the host was not focusable and no key was bound outside the hidden
  accessibility tree, so the only way in was fourteen presses of Tab. The chart
  is now a tab stop — the first one inside itself — and answers to arrows (Shift
  for a stride), `+`/`-`, `f`, `0`, `Home` and `Esc`. Keys are left alone when
  focus is inside an input, a `<select>`, or a row of the accessibility tree,
  which has its own arrows for moving between nodes rather than moving the view.
  `keyboard: false` opts out, including the tab stop.

  **`fitSubtree(id)`.** Frames one branch rather than the whole chart. On a chart
  of tens of thousands of nodes, fitting everything means a zoom level where
  nothing can be read; "show me Engineering" is the question people have.

  **`getView()` / `setView(view)`.** Where a viewer is — camera, open branches,
  highlight — as one plain serialisable object naming nodes by id. Put it in a
  URL and you have a link to a place in a chart; ids that have since left the
  tree are ignored rather than throwing, so an old bookmark still opens.
  `ChartState` gained `highlighted` for the same reason.

- 06e2340: Selection: `select(ids)`, `getSelection()`, a `selectionChange` event, and
  pointer selection behind `selection: true`.

  What the viewer picked, kept separate from what `highlight` says the chart is
  pointing at. The two co-occur constantly — select three people, then search —
  so they are stored separately and drawn differently, through new
  `selectionStroke` / `selectionStrokeWidth` theme tokens. A selected node keeps
  its own outline underneath and is drawn at every zoom, including the tier where
  unselected nodes are shapes.

  With `selection: true`, the pointer selects: click replaces, ctrl/cmd-click
  toggles one, shift-click adds, shift-drag draws a box, alt-drag draws a lasso,
  a click on the background clears, and `Esc` clears both selection and
  highlight. Off by default, because a chart written before this existed already
  has a meaning for a click.

  Also fixes the minimap after `isolate`: it held its old frame, so an isolated
  branch was drawn at the whole chart's scale, in the corner the whole chart used
  to occupy.

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- 94c71aa: First release.

  A framework-agnostic org chart for trees far too large to give a DOM node each.
  Layout and drawing happen on a `<canvas>` inside a Web Worker; real components
  are mounted only for the nodes that are both on screen and zoomed in far enough
  to read — about fifty at a time, pooled and reused. 5,000–50,000 nodes at
  60fps.

  - **Layout** — tidy tree in four orientations, RTL, per-node sizes, and a
    staged expand/collapse transition that keeps the toggled node pinned to the
    pixel it was on.
  - **Your components on top** — a Vue `#node` slot, a React render prop, or
    plain DOM. Each node's context carries its own subtree counts, precomputed
    once per tree rather than counted while drawing.
  - **Navigation** — `focus` opens the way to a node before centring on it,
    `pathTo` + `highlight` paint the route from the root, plus search, a full
    keyboard tree, a screen-reader tree, and a minimap that holds its frame
    steady across a toggle.
  - **Export** — SVG and PNG, drawn from the same geometry as the canvas.
  - **Themeable** — every colour, weight and radius the canvas uses, live
    through `setTheme`, with `DEFAULT_THEME` and `DARK_THEME` ready to spread.
  - **Gestures** — drag to pan with momentum, wheel to zoom, pinch on touch. The
    chart claims exactly the gestures it uses and leaves the rest, right-click
    included, to you.

  ESM only. TypeScript throughout.
